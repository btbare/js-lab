    // -> text from the chapter below:
    //  the price of a single rose (8) and the number of roses you have (70)
    //  the price of a single lily (10) and the number of lilies you have (50)
    //  the price of a single tulip (2) and the number of tulips you have (120)

    //  Now declare three variables, one each for the roses, lilies, and tulips you have, 
    //  in which you place their total price. Insert the corresponding values into the 
    //  variables using the variables declared in the previous step. Finally, declare a 
    //  variable in which you store the price of all your flowers (again, use the previous 
    //  variables for initialization). Display all inventory information in the console     
    //  in the following form:

    let rosePrice = 8
    let roseAmount = 70

    let lilyPrice = 10
    let lilyAmount = 50

    let tulipPrice = 2
    let tulipAmount = 120

    // using anon function to allow interchangable function
    // more DRY 
    // and less i didn have to type as much

    const flowerInfo = (flower, fPrice, fAmount) => {
        console.log(flower, " - unit price: ", fPrice, ", quantity: ", fAmount, "value: ", fPrice*fAmount)
    }

    flowerInfo("Rose", rosePrice, roseAmount)
    flowerInfo("Lily", lilyPrice, lilyAmount)
    flowerInfo("Tulip", tulipPrice, tulipAmount)

    // -> im sure there is means to make an interchangable function that 
    // calc the totals easier than this console.log() but i m lay z :P

    console.log("total: $", rosePrice*roseAmount + lilyPrice*lilyAmount + tulipPrice*tulipAmount)
